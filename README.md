## Project Description
There are institutions that don't have easy ways to categorize or present their training resources. Currently, HPC-ED utilizes a command-line interface (CLI) to add data (training material) to and query data from a database which is not at all user friendly or intuitive. Many people don't know how to use a CLI, so they don't get the opportunity to use the training resources.

Furthermore, most people go to Google for their needs which isn't the best way to search. A given Google query might return thousands of results, making it hard to know which ones are worth looking at because the quality of sources vary. By having a database that stores only the institution-quality training materials and resources, you can be sure that all of the results from querying the database will be useful in some manner.
